These are the files attached
1) GROUP REPORT 
2) SIMULATION :- A visual C# and Silverlight4 project which contains Source code. 
                Need to run in Visual Studio 2010 or higher.

3)INPUT files :- "input2.txt", "input3.txt", "input4.txt"
	           NOTE: Please copy and paste above mentioned files in "MyDocuments" folder in your system while running simulation.
                            These are the Input configuration files which when run generates suitable test case.
                            Below mentioned TESR CASE# description is mentioned in GROUP REPORT.
	          
		 For TEST CASE1------------->Please include "input2.txt" file.
		 For TEST CASE2------------->Please include "input3.txt" file.
		 For TEST CASE3------------->Please include "input4.txt" file.

4)OUTPUT file :- "Output.txt" -->Has output for given input file "input4.txt" which is Test case 3.
 	           NOTE: After running simulation you can find an "Output.txt" generated in your "MyDocuments" folder.
                            This is the Output file which is generated after simulation is complete.
                            


STEPS TO RUN SIMULATION

Step 1) After opening "SIMULATION", go to "Ver10" and then to "Distributed ComputingProject".

Step 2) Now open "Distributed ComputingProject" which is a Microsoft Visual studio solution file.

	NOTE: In oder to enable file reading from given input configuration file, following changes have to be made in Visual Studio.

	a) In Solution Explorer window, Right Click on "DistributedComputingProjectFinal" file and select "properties".
	b) Now on opened "DistributedComputingProjectFinal" file, select Silverlight option.
	c) Check on "Enable running application out of the browser" option
	d) Click on "Out-of-Browser-settings" 
	e) Enable "Show install menu"and "Require elevated trust when running outside the browser" options and select "Window Style"as Default.
	 f) Press ok.

Step 3) To run simulation press "START" button or "F5" button

Step 4) A screen appears on any browser. Press "simulate" and wait till "Finally we are Done" message appears.

Step 5) Now we can see results in "output.txt" file which is in "MyDocuments" folder.

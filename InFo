•  Advanced Computer Networks -“ IMPLEMENTATION OF AN INTER AND INTRA DOMAIN PATH VECTOR ROUTING PROTOCOL ”																           			                      

An intra-domain and inter-domain routing protocols was developed which used path vector routing concept. 
Each domain had inter-domain routers and a gateway router. Gateway routers of each domain ran an inter-domain 
routing process to communicate routes of their respective domains with other gateway routers. 
Validity of this project was tested by sending messages from any source to any destination.
This project is coded using C (Socket programming).
